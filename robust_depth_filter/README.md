# Robust Depth Filter

- The filter requires the AQUALOC dataset. Check the folder ```AQUALOC``` to find out how to download the dataset and place appropriate ```.txt``` files in the dataset.
- The prototyping code is given as a Jupyter notebook (```Prototyping filter.ipynb```). You can use it to tune filter gains ```g``` and ```h```.
- The folder ```C code``` contains the deployable version of the filter written in Mbed C. The code can be run on Mbed-enabled boards.
